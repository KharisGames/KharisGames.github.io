I have started using GitHub for development. The two games I'm currently working on are uploaded. I have little experience with version control systems, so learning to use Git is also a new adventure. 

This webpage is hosted on GitHub Pages. If you need a webpage hosted for free, and don't need dynamic content like PHP, GitHub Pages is fantastic and very fast. (Dynamic functionality can be accomplished with JavaScript.)
