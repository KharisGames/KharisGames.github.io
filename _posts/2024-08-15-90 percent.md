There's a saying:

Euclidean Space Explorer is coming along. I had to redesign the control UI from scratch. And many more small tweaks. It seems that the more I tweak, the more things need to be tweaked. Soon all that is needed is the tutorials, and designing kore levels. I already have the first 11 levels, so design of further levels will continue after release.
