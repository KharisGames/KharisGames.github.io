Kharis */kəˈɹɪz/* (as in charisma) comes from the Greek word χάρις meaning grace, good will, loving-kindness, or favour. I'm just one guy learning how to develop video games, and I invite you on the journey. The games I develop I want to uplift, educate, inspire and engage the players. This is just a part time deal, so development may be slow, but I am interested in you and your ideas, so please share and let's discover game development together.
