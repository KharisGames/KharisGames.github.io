Today I uploaded my code to github for the first time. I am not used to working with Git in a development project. I usually do the 1990's style of just keeping track of everything myself and having a bad time when things go wrong. So this is a learning experience for me. I put them in private repostitories for now, because I while I don't want to be a miser, I want to have some control of my creative works.
