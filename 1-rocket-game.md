# COMING SOON

**Explore equclidian space and learn trigonometry on the way!** You will captain the space ship Euclid through a mine field of asteroids, meteors and planets, picking up power-ups along the way, and landing safely at your destination. Euclid is controlled by programming its navigation computer using mathematic formulas. 

How high Euclid is flying (Y-axis) is calculated based on how far it has traveled (X-axis). By using mathematic functions such a sine, cosine, tangent, logaritms, and ao on, the path that Euclid takes can be accurately charted.

This game allows children of all ages to experiment with and learn basic trigonometry in a fun way. The game provides instant feedback, which is important for learning, especially for neurodivergent students with attention difficultues.
